These are some sample codes for the solution of diffusion problems outside three dimensional geometries using Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC). The KMC method knits exactly solvable projectors into arbitrary diffusive paths. The surface of the domain, represented by a triangulation, can be either absorbing or reflecting. Methods described in the paper:
